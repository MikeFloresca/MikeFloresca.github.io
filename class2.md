# What is a Markdown?

  First is understanding what a *syntax* is. By definition a *syntax* is the arrangement of words and phrases to create well-formed sentences in a language.
 This tells the computer how to read the code. A *markdown* is a plain text formatting syntax aimed at making writing for the internet easier. 
 
 Here are some examples:
 
- to make a word italic using Markdown, you enclose the word in *(asteriks). By placing a word between two asteriks 
 will make it looke like this *word*.
 
 - to create a heading, add one to six # symbols before your heading text. The number of # you use will determine the size of the heading.
   # Heading ## heading ### heading #### heading
   
 - You can create an inline link by wrapping link text in brackets [ ], and then wrapping the URL in parentheses ( ). You can also use the keyboard shortcut Command+K to create a link. When you have text selected, you can paste a URL from your clipboard to automatically create a link from the selection.
