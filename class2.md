# Git Intro

## What is Git?

*Git is a Distributed Version Control systems that stores data in a file system made up of snapshots.\
Each time you save a changed version of your project — called commit — Git creates a snapshot of the file and stores a reference to it.\
Git tracks the changes you make to files, so you have a record of what has been done, and you can revert to specific versions should you ever need to.\
Git also makes collaboration easier, allowing changes by multiple people to all be merged into one source.
