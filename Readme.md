## **Growth Mindset**
                                                                                                             
I believe growth mindset is the idea that you can learn and develop abilities with effort and persistince.
That you can get better in anything if you put your energy and effort into. Achieving goals and projects
by embracing challenges and criticism and learning skills along the way allowing you to reach your full potential.


### 3 Reminders to stay in that mindset
- _Challenges_

Viewing challenges as an opportunity to expand your knowledge. Instead of avoiding it, embrace it!

- _Creating a habit_

Start off with something small and build up to it. Wether it be reading a book or watching videos to expand your knowledge.
Read a chapter or two a day and continue to build on that habit. It only takes a couple of weeks to build a habit but it must come 
with some ***effort***.

- _Perspective_

How you view things can play a big role on your growth mindset. What some may see as a failure you see as a learning oppurtunity.
Perspective impacts your potential, it's a story you tell yourself and others.
