## **Growth Mindset**
                                                                                                             
I believe growth mindset is the idea that you can learn and develop abilities with effort and persistince.
That you can get better in anything if you put your energy and effort into. Achieving goals and projects
by embracing challenges and criticism and learning skills along the way allowing you to reach your full potential.
