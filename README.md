<sub>In my own words </sub>

Growth mindset is a belief that you can learn and develop abilities with effort and persistince.
Its the idea that you can get better in anything if you put your energy and effort into it. Achieving goals and projects
by embracing challenges and criticism and learning skills along the way allowing you to reach your full potential.
